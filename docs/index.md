# What is Geekathon AI Starter Template

Geekathon AI Starter Template is a project that helps you to quickly start a new AI Project.
It provides you with a starting codebase, and a functional demo project, from where you can build you project up on.

The codebase is developed with NextJS, and makes use of OpenAI models, as well as Pinecone for vector database and Replicate for image generation.

Another cool benefit is that the deployment part is already made up for you.
As soon as you request your instance of this project, you will have access to:

- a github repo
- a project url, where you can see it running live (it will be hosted in a xgeeks kubernetes cluster)
- also, all the pipeline for the new feature deployments will be set and ready to receive your commits.

This is possible via xgeeks IDP (Internal Developer Platform), that allow developers to self service their new projects resources, as easy as it is to fill out a small form and click a button.
